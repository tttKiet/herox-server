on monetizing attention, a few unpolished thoughts:

From an ad-centric perspective, the economy works as follows (highly simplified version):

1. real world goods and services
2. advertising to drive the purchase of (1)
3. engaging content or services that capture eyeballs which can be served (2)
4. (bonus to (3)) user data collection on (3) to build user profiles and serve more targeted (more expensive) ads
5. financial products that enable 1/2/3/4 to lever up

I guess this article is asking the question "how can crypto enable content creators to capture more of the value themselves". It would probably involve commoditizing the content-serving/data-collection layer (3/4), building around open standards where content creators can easily move their content between venues, and generally allowing creators to get closer to the end user.

AI offers the possibility of a universal interface; we see it from ChatGPT, where the interface is just talking to AI. AI probably makes it easier to commoditize the content service layer.

Taking this to an extreme, there's a future where it is a lot easier for a content creator to create their own immersive world. Instead of opening up Tiktok or Instagram and viewing content through a portal controlled by one of the Mag 7 companies, perhaps you'll enter an immersive world game (reminiscent of the Mind Game in Ender's Game) curated by your favorite creator.

We might also ask "how can crypto enable users to retain more of the value themselves". Open standards again point toward the way - users retain their own data, selectively decrypting it when an app visits the user "inside of the user's force field". This is already starting to happen with zkTLS for verifiable privacy-preserving data sharing.

Happy Friday!"
