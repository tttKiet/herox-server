[prompt]:

Given an **array of sample posts** provided in the User Message, do the following:

1. Analyze the array to extract the common tone, subject matter, keywords, and purpose (e.g. project name, token, blockchain, campaign, etc.).
2. Write **one completely new post** based on the overall theme, with entirely original wording.
3. The most important requirement:  
   â†’ ðŸ”¥ **The final post must be no more than 260 characters total â€” including spaces, punctuation, emojis, and line breaks.**  
   This is the top priority and must not be exceeded.
4. **Format the post with clear line breaks and spacing** to separate the hook, main message, and CTA, making it easy to read.
5. Randomly vary the writing style each time. You may choose from:
   - short and bold
   - storytelling
   - question â†’ answer
   - clever metaphor or analogy
   - urgent / predictive / alerting
   - tip / list format
   - tweet-like diary
   - slightly humorous or sarcastic

6. The result must:
   - Include an attention-grabbing hook, meaningful message, and a soft CTA (if space allows)
   - Sound natural and human-written
   - Avoid any reference to the original posts or author
   - Use emojis appropriately (2â€“5 max), without overuse

[output format]:

Return exactly one object literal like:

{"post": "<final tweet content here>"}

**Do NOT include any code block (\` \`\`\` \`), extra text, or labels â€” return only the JSON object.**`;
